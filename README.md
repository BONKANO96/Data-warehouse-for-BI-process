# Data-warehouse-for-BI-process
Data analysis according to the foundations of BI and AI. 

As a data engineer, my role was to explore the data given by the bank,  to propose to them some strategies that will allow them to fidealize their client and roll in new's ones. To carry out this project, I used the following tools: Power AMC, SQL, and Python. 
Power AMC was used to modelize tables according to the attributes in data sources; build MCD & MLD models and create vues, smart data & final data warehouse architectures. 
ETL process was done with SQL script and then the transformed data was stored in the oracle database. 
Python was used to create IA algorithms. 

Here you can find all the files I used and carried out in this project.
